# thalamocortical_expansion
When light enters the eye, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are stimulated. They pass this information down the optic nerve to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in a near 1:1 neuron ratio. Following this, there is a large expansion in the number of neurons in the mammalian brain, where the few LGN neurons pass information to the primary visual cortex (V1) neurons at a ratio of 1:300 (in humans). The goal of this project is to explore the thalamocortical expansion and assess how this impacts processing in the brain.

## files
- `model.py` contains code for the RGC2LGN and LGN2V1 models, along with modified triplet loss. These files are the essential components of the system.
