# TODO
a todo list of items for this project

## for now
- [X] implement LGN2V1 network as a single layer nn
- [X] implement RGC2LGN network as a set of multi-scale gaussian filters
- [X] test LGN2V1 network on varying numbers of V1 neurons with flattened input digits and basic triplet loss to recreate Mario's results
- [ ] test LGN2V1 network with flattened LGN inputs and varying V1 neurons with a modified triplet loss
- [ ] test LGN2V1 network with multi-scale gaussian (RGC2LGN) inputs and modified triplet loss

## for down the road
- [ ] add convolutions to the expansion network
- [ ] add convolutions to the RGC2LGN network
