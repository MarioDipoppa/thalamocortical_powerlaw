# TODO
a todo list of items for this project

## for now
- [X] implement LGN2V1 network as a single layer nn
- [X] implement RGC2LGN network as a set of multi-scale gaussian filters
- [ ] test the LGN2V1 network on varying numbers of LGN/V1 neurons with basic triplet loss to recreate Mario's results
- [ ] test the LGN2V1 network on the same set of LGN/V1 neurons with a modified triplet loss

## for down the road
- [ ] add convolutions to the expansion network
- [ ] add convolutions to the RGC2LGN network
